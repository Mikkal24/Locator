# Locator

This application surfaces the contact's location to provide more context about the contact for your agents.
It also includes the time at the contact's location. 

### The following information is displayed:

* User Location
* Current time at the user's location
* A button to hide the map because it's not super necessary

Please submit bug reports to [https://github.com/Mikkal24/Locator](https://github.com/Mikkal24/Locator).

### How I use this app:

- Response: "Have a good rest of your evening!" instead of "have a good day!"

- Utility: It's really easy to see if there is a connection issue from certain regions with this app

- Utility: Hightened suspicion if the contact's account is different than the one they are contacting from.
