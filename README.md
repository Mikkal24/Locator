# Locator

This application surfaces the contact's location to provide more context for your agents.
It also includes the time at the contact's location. 

### The following information is displayed:

* User Location
* Current time at the user's location
* A button to hide the map because it's not super necessary

Please submit bug reports to [https://github.com/Mikkal24/Locator](https://github.com/Mikkal24/Locator).
